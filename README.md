# Rust Expert | AI LLM | [Work in progress]

An expert LLM for Rust, built by fine-tuning a base model (SFT) and then refining it with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from expert feedback. It leverages a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for efficient scaling and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to access up-to-date information, ensuring the generation of high-quality, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code.
